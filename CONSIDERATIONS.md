## Considerations that should yield design principles

1. Should operations return HTTP response objects or domain objects?

2. Should list operations:
  a. Completely populate the domain object for each item in the list, or
  b. Partially populate the domain object for each item in the list, or
  c. Not populate the domain object for each item in the list?
